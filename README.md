# Robot Icons Transfer

this code transfer icons from the icons folder to the icons folder of material icons based on where the extension is

## How The Code Works

the code works by using shutils library
the code ask the user where to put the icons: (either wpilib or default vscode)
after couple of questions to determined where to put the icons the code will put all of the icons there

## How To Excecute

this is a simple python code
using `python __init__.py` command in a cmd in the workspace folder will run the code

## Important Note

if material icons update their version of extension the code will not works as the vscode folder name change by the version
if this is happening all you need to do is to put the extension version name in \_\_init\_\_.py in the materialIconVersion variable
